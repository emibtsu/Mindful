# Mindful
Our mission is to bring a level of authenticity and mental health awareness never seen before in the social media space. We want to harness the power of social media to promote mindful behavior, and focus on healthy reflection and authenticity above all else. Mindful is an a social journaling platform, used for sharing all of the positive things that bring us together. With tools such as shared prompts and insights, Mindful will be the common ground for people of all backgrounds to reflect and rejoice together.

# Development Information
Mindful was developed as a part of an University entrepreneurship class in which our team of 5 created a list of business canvases and plans, and then executed on those plans. We used React Native, Expo, and SQL as our tech stack. Unfortunately the app did not make it to production and we decided to cease development at the end of the semester.
